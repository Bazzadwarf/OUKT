# OUKT

These are some wiki pages that I made for the osu! UK Tournament series hosted by PortalLife (Daiya) and co.

I've been meaning to PR these for a while but I probably need to get them back up to current tournament pages standards for the [osu!wiki](https://www.github.com/ppy/osu-wiki) 

## ToDo's
- ~~Find a the OUKT4 GF Pool~~ (Thank you [FlagFlayer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14289115) for remaking this from a [VOD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoLCE76c9wE)!)
- Check formatting and spellings
